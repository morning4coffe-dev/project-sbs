# Recurrents - Privacy Policy 

## How We Collect and Use Information 

### Telemetry 
Recurrents collects anonymous, aggregate telemetry to enhance user experience. Examples include tracking the number of times a subscription has been added or removed. This information is not personally identifiable and is solely used to understand user interactions with Recurrents. Telemetry data helps guide future development and improvements. It is important to note that this data is not utilized for marketing or sales purposes, and it is not shared with any third parties.


### Signing In
When users sign in to Recurrents using their Microsoft account, the data is uploaded exclusively to their personal OneDrive. The app requests access only to the app-specific folder, which is automatically created within the user's OneDrive account. No user data is sent to our servers. This approach ensures the security and privacy of user information, limiting its storage and access to the designated app folder within the user's personal OneDrive account. For further information on Microsoft's privacy policies, users can refer to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
